# Kelley Morse Theory of Classes

# [prove off]

# We follow the appendix of John L. Kelley 
# General Topology D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilber-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del.
# 
# We change the ontology by distinguishing classes and objects.
# A class that is an object is a set.
# We restrict definitions of operations like 
# singletons and pairs to objects, when it is not necessary to
# apply them to classes. 
# This file uses SADs inbuilt set notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley. However we have replaced the keyword "set"
# by "class"

# The universal class is no longer used to indicate undefinedness.
# So several theorems dealing with that view can be omitted.

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

Let a \noteq b stand for a != b.

Let x, y, z, r, s, t stand for classes.

[object/-s]
Signature. An object is a notion.
Let a, b, c, d, e stand for objects.

# Ontological axiom:
Axiom. Every element of x is an object.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y x = y iff for each object z z \in x iff z \in y.

# These are the classes of KM
[set/-s]
Definition 1. A set is a class that is an object.

# Axiom II, the classification axiom-scheme is built into
# the class mechanisms of SAD.

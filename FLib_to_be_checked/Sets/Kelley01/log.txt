Kelley01 is a folder to carry through the Kelley formalisation.

01-55_original correspond to the original Kelley text based on classes where sets are defined as (classes which are) elements of classes.

The original class ontology is changed for an ontology of classes whose elements are objects. Here a set is defined as a class which is an object. So there may be objects which as not sets, like for example ordered pairs.

Looking through the first 55 items in the ontology of Class11.ftl

Certain items are no longer supported:  
Theorem 34a: 0 = \bigcap UU fails.
Theorem 34b: UU = \bigcup UU fails.
Theorem 37. UU = 2^UU. We can have 2^UU \subset UU.
Theorem 39. UU is not a set.

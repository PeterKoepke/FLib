Let x,y,z,r,s stand for sets.

[thing/-s]
Signature. An thing is a notion.

Signature. An element of a set is a thing.

Let a,b,c,d stand for things.

Let a \in b stand for a is an element of b.

Signature. [a,b] is a thing.
# Let the ordered pair of a and b stand for [a,b].

Axiom. If [a,b]=[c,d] then a=c and b=d.

Definition. A relation is a set r such 
that for every d \in r there exist a and b such that d = [a,b].

Definition. r^{-1} = { d | there exist a and b and c such that (c \in r and c = [a,b] and d = [b,a]) }.

Lemma. Let r be a relation. Then (r^{-1})^{-1} = r.

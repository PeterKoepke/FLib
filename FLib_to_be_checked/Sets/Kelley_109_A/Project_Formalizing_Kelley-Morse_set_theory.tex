Formalizing Kelley-Morse Set Theory.

Kelley-Morse Set Theory is a theory of sets and classes that can 
serve as a foundation of mathematics. It is presented rather formally
in the appendix of "General Topology" of Kelley. The formal
basis of the current SAD3 system is close to Kelley-Morse Set Theory.
Therefore it is worthwhile to formalize the appendix in SAD3.

The text at hand poses some difficulties but it should eventually be
possible to parse large parts of the axioms, definions and theorems
verbatim. For complexity reasons it seems necessary to make some
ontological changes to the text. Sets are defined in terms of classes,
ordered pairs are complicated compositions of set operations.

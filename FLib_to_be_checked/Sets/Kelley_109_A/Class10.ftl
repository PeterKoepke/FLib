# Kelley Morse Theory of Classes

# [prove off]

# We follow the appendix of John L. Kelley 
# General Topology D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilber-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del.

# This file covers the first 56 top level sections of the appendix.
# It uses SADs inbuilt set notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley.

# This file checks in 3 min on my laptop.

# Elementary Set Theory

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

# We formalize "classes" of KM by 
# the inbuilt "sets" in SAD3.
# We allow elements of sets to be structureless
# atoms which we call maob, for "mathematical object".

# Axioms I and II are built into SAD3.

Let x, y, z, r, s, t stand for sets.

Let a \in b stand for a is an element of b.

# thing is the temporary denotation of "mathematical objects"
# mob
[thing/-s]
Signature. A thing is a notion. 

Let a, b, c stand for things.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y x = y iff for each thing z z \in x iff z \in y.

# These are the sets of KM
[sset/-s]
Definition 1. A sset is a set that is a thing.

# be a set or UU (= undefined).

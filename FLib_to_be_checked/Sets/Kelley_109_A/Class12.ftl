# Kelley Morse Theory of Classes

# [prove off]

# We follow the appendix of John L. Kelley 
# General Topology D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilber-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del.
# 
# We change the ontology by distinguishing classes and objects.
# A class that is an object is a set.
# We restrict definitions of operations like 
# singletons and pairs to objects, when it is not necessary to
# apply them to classes. 
# This file uses SADs inbuilt set notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley. However we have replaced the keyword "set"
# by "class"

# Elementary set Theory

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

Let a \noteq b stand for a != b.

Let x, y, z, r, s, t stand for classes.

[object/-s]
Signature. An object is a notion.
Let a, b, c, d, e stand for objects.

Let a \in x stand for a is an element of x.

# Ontological axiom:
Axiom. Every element of x is an object.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y x = y iff for each object z z \in x iff z \in y.

# These are the classes of KM
[set/-s]
Definition 1. A set is a class that is an object.

Definition 2. x \cup y = { object u | u \in x or u \in y }.
# Definition 3. x \cap y = { object u | u \in x and u \in y }.

# Axiom II, the classification axiom-scheme is built into
# the class mechanisms of SAD.

# Elementary Algebra of Classes


# Definition 9.
# Let a \notin b stand for a is not an element of b.


# Definition 18. UU = {object u | u = u}.
# Let the universe stand for UU.

# Theorem 19. x \in UU iff x is an object.

Definition 25. A subclass of y is a class x such that each element of x is an element of y. 
Let x \subset y stand for x is a subclass of y.
Let x is contained in y stand for x \subset y.

Theorem 27. x = y iff x \subset y and y \subset x.

Theorem 28. If x \subset y and y \subset z then x \subset z.


# Axiom of subclasses.
# Axiom III. If x is a set then there is a set y such that for each
# z if z \subset x then z \in y.

# This axiom is a kind of powerset axiom, where the powerset
# also has all subCLASSES as elements. Since elements are sets
# these subclasses will be sets. So the separation scheme follows.

# Theorem 33. If x is a set and z \subset x then z is a set.


# Definition. RR = {set x | x \notin x}.

# Theorem. RR is not a set.

# Theorem 39. UU is not a set.


# Ordered Pairs; Relations

# Definition 48. Let x,y be objects. [x,y] = <<x>,<x,y>>.
# Let the ordered pair of x and y stand for [x,y].

# Theorem 49a. If x,y are objects then [x,y] is a set.
# Theorem 49b. If [x,y] is not an object then [x,y] = UU.

Signature 48. [a,b] is an object.

Definition. An ordered pair is an object c such that there exist
objects a and b such that c = [a,b].

# Theorem 50a. If x and y are objects then 
#  \bigcup [x,y] = <x,y> and
#  \bigcap [x,y] = <x> and
#  \bigcup \bigcap [x,y] = x and
#  \bigcap \bigcap [x,y] = x and
#  \bigcup \bigcup [x,y] = x \cup y and
#  \bigcap \bigcup [x,y] = x \cap y.

# Theorem. If x is not an object or y is not an object then
#   \bigcup \bigcap [x,y] = 0 and
#   \bigcap \bigcap [x,y] = UU and
#   \bigcup \bigcup [x,y] = UU and
#  \bigcap \bigcup [x,y] = 0.

# Definition 51. Let z be a set. 1st z = \bigcap \bigcap z.

#Definition 52. Let z be a set. 2nd z = (\bigcap \bigcup z) \cup 
#((\bigcup \bigcup z) ~ \bigcup \bigcap z). 
#Let the first coordinate of z stand for 1st z.
#Let the second coordinate of z stand for 2nd z.

# Theorem 53. 2nd UU = UU.

#Theorem 54a. If x and y are objects then 1st [x,y] = x.
#Theorem 54b. If x and y are objects then 2nd [x,y] = y.
#Proof. Let x and y be objects.
#2nd [x,y] = (\bigcap \bigcup [x,y]) \cup 
#((\bigcup \bigcup [x,y]) ~ \bigcup \bigcap [x,y])
#= (x \cap y) \cup ((x \cup y) ~ x)
#= y.
#qed.

# Theorem 54c. If x is not an object or y is not an object then
# 1st [x,y] = UU and 2nd [x,y] = UU.

# Theorem 55. If x,y,r,s are objects and [x,y] = [r,s] then
# x = r and y = s.

Axiom 55. If [a,b] = [c,d] then
a = c and b = d.

# We can now extend the signature (our language)
# by [ , ], satisfying axioms ... .
# Ideally, we would like [ , ] an "object" and
# not a class. This requires classes to be objects.
# For the moment, we can however agree [ , ] to
# be a class or UU (= undefined).

[relation/-s]
Definition 56. A relation is a class r such that
every element of r is an ordered pair.

Let r,s,t stand for relations.

Definition 57. r \circ s =
{[x,z] | x,z are objects and there exists b such that 
[x,b] \in s and [b,z] \in r}.

Theorem 58. (r \circ s) \circ t = r \circ (s \circ t).
Proof. (r \circ s) \circ t \subset r \circ (s \circ t) and
r \circ (s \circ t) \subset (r \circ s) \circ t.
qed.

Theorem 59a. r \circ (s \cup t) = (r \circ s) \cup (r \circ t).
Proof. r \circ (s \cup t) \subset (r \circ s) \cup (r \circ t).
(r \circ s) \cup (r \circ t) \subset r \circ (s \cup t).
qed.

# Theorem 59b. r \circ (s \cap t) \subset (r \circ s) \cap (r \circ t).


Definition 60. r^{-1} = {[b,a] | a,b are objects and [a,b] \in r}.
Let the relation inverse to r stand for r^{-1}.

Lemma. r^{-1} is a relation.

Theorem 61. (r^{-1})^{-1} = r.
Proof.
r \subset (r^{-1})^{-1}.
(r^{-1})^{-1} \subset r.
qed.

Lemma 62a. Assume r \subset s. Then r^{-1} \subset s^{-1}.

Lemma 62b. (r \circ s)^{-1} \subset (s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}).

Lemma. (s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}) \subset (r \circ s)^{-1}.
Proof.
((s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}))^{-1} \subset 
((r^{-1})^{-1}) \circ ((s^{-1})^{-1}) (by 62b) .
((s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}))^{-1} \subset 
r \circ s (by 61) .
(((s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}))^{-1})^{-1} \subset 
(r \circ s)^{-1} (by 62a).
(s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}) \subset (r \circ s)^{-1} (by 61).
qed.

Theorem 62. (r \circ s)^{-1} = (s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}).
Proof. (r \circ s)^{-1} \subset (s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}).
(s^{-1}) \circ (r^{-1}) \subset (r \circ s)^{-1}.

a,b,c if [a,b] \in f and [a,c] \in f then b = c.

Let f,g stand for maps.

Theorem 64. If f, g are maps then f \circ g is a map.

Definition 65. \domain x = {object u | there exists an object v 
such that [u,v] \in x}.

Definition 66. \range x = {object v | there exists an object u 
such that [u,v] \in x}.

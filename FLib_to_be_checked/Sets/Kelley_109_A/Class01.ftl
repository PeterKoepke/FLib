# Kelley Morse Theory of Classes

# We follow the appendix of John L. Kelley 
# General Topology D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilber-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del.

# The appendix is called:

# Elementary Set Theory

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

# We formalize "classes" of KM by 
# the imbuilt "sets" in SAD3.

# Axioms I and II are built into SAD3.

# [prove off]

Let x, y, z, u,v, a, b, c, d, e stand for sets.

Let a \in b stand for a is an element of b.

# We also allow certain atomic objects:

Signature. A thing is a notion.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y 
x = y iff for each set z z \in x iff z \in y.

# We formalize "sets" of KM by defining
# a notion of "sset" (for "small set")

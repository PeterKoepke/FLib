Welche Konfiguration benutzen wir:
Isabelle: isabelle/bin/isabelle jedit

Isabelle uses as Naproche-component:
init_component "/home/koepke/NAPROCHE-Test/Naproche-SAD"
This entry made in ~/isabelle/etc/settings:172

Naproche-SAD is coded in the directory
~/NAPROCHE-Test/Naproche-SAD/src/SAD
and is compiled by:
koepke@dell:~/NAPROCHE-Test/Naproche-SAD$ stack build

This build can also be used independently of Isabelle with
koepke@dell:~/NAPROCHE-Test/Naproche-SAD$ stack exec Naproche-SAD -- /home/koepke/Naproche-SAD/examples/ordinals08.ftl -vvvvvv >> test.txt
Then one can inspect the file ~/NAPROCHE-Test/Naproche-SAD/test.txt
and vary the verbosity

The present Naproche has the ontology of the file on ordinals:
~/Naproche-SAD/examples/ordinals08.ftl
(Hardcoded "classes",+
Signature: An object is a notion.
Axiom: Any element of any class is an object.
Definition: A set is a class that is an object.)

Training files: ordinals08, and also Kelley

Put the Training files into ~/NAPROCHE-Test/Naproche-SAD/Kelley
as
Sections_1-56_original.ftl

We adapt Naproche-SAD to the notation from Kelley by disabling
some inbuilt notations like ( , ) for ordered pairs or { , ,,,} 
for finite sets.
This is done at the following places:
finite sets: { , ,,,}:
ForThel/Statement.hs:384 change symbSetNotation
ordered pairs: ( , ):
Forthel/Base.hs:84 change part of initFS

We have closed Sections_1-56_original.ftl for the moment and
are turning to an ontology with objects, sets, and classes in
Sections_1-56_with_objects.ftl

There are some difficulties with some arguments, that fail if not
everything is a class. Therefore we have to pull some set existence
properties forward as axioms.

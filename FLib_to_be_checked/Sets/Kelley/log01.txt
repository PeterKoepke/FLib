Formalizing Kelley's Appendix in Naproche-SAD

We work in the Isabelle jedit environment.
We modify the Naproche-SAD source code as needed. In particular,
certain inbuilt mechanisms are modified for our purposes and to get
consistency: abstraction terms are registered as classes, 
function definitions register their domains as classes.

We use the ~/NAPROCHE/ directory which contains
- Naproche-SAD in the directory ... Naproche-SAD/; there one finds a "stack"
version of Naproche-SAD which can be built by "stack build". The sources compiled are
in .../src/SAD/.

- Isabelle as a runtime  .../isabelle/bin/isabelle. Mainly use isabelle jedit

- eprover in the directory .../E

# Kelley Morse Theory of Sets and Classes

# We formalize the 

# Appendix: ELEMENTARY SET THEORY 

# of John L. Kelley 
# GENERAL TOPOLOGY 
# D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
#
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilbert-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del."

# This file covers the first 56 top level sections of the appendix
# in an alternative ontoloy.
# We use SADs inbuilt class notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley. Classes consist of objects, and
# sets are classes that are objects themselves.
# This leads to a conservative variant of Kelley Morse class theory 
# without difficulties about the exact construction of
# ordered pairs and notions derived from ordered pairs like
# relations and functions.
# The new ontology leads to restructurings of the text.
# We shall, e.g., omit Theorems that are concerned with using
# UU as an indicator of "undefined".

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

# [prove off]

Let a \neq b stand for a != b.

Let x, y, z, r, s, t stand for classes.
Let a, b, c, d, e stand for objects.

Let a \in x stand for a is an element of x.

# Ontological axiom:
Axiom. Every element of x is an object.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y we have 
x = y iff for each object a a \in x iff a \in y.

[synonym set/-s]
Definition 1. A set is a class that is an object.

# Axiom II, the classification axiom-scheme is built into
# the class mechanisms of SAD.

# Existence of sets

# Axiom of subsets.
Axiom III. If x is a set then there is a set y such that for each
z if z \subclass x then z \in y.

# This axiom is a kind of powerclass axiom, where the powerclass
# also has all subCLASSES as elements.

# This is Zermelo's axiom of separation:

Theorem 33. If x is a set and z \subclass x then z is a set.

# In the original ontology, Theorem 34 was provable, because
# all elements were sets. Since now we also allow objects we have to
# pull some set existence properties forward as axioms.

Axiom. 0 is a set.

Theorem 34a. 0 = \bigcap UU.

# The other part of Theorem 34 will be done after the introduction
# of singletons.

Theorem 35. If x has an element that is a set then \bigcap x is a set.

Definition 36. 2^x = {set y | y \subclass x}.

# The following theorem had to be adjusted to the new ontology.
Theorem 37. 2^UU = {set y | y = y }.

Theorem 38. If x is a set then 2^x is a set and for
each y  y \subclass x iff y \in 2^x.
Proof. Let x be a set.
Take a set y such that for each z 
if z \subclass x then z \in y (by III).
2^x \subclass y.

Let the unordered pair of x and y stand for {x,y}.

Proof. Let x,y be sets.
\bigcup {x,y} \subclass x \cup y.
x \cup y \subclass \bigcup {x,y}.

# Ordered Pairs; Relations

# [/prove]

Theorem 55. If (a,b) = (c,d) then

# We can now extend the signature (our language)
# by an elementary symbol ( , ), satisfying standard axioms ... .
# where ordered pairs are objects.

Definition 56. A relation is a class r such that for each element c of r
there exist a and b such that c = (a,b).

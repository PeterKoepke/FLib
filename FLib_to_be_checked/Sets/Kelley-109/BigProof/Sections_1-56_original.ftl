# Kelley Morse Theory of Sets and Classes

# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilbert-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del."

# This file covers the first 56 top level sections of the appendix.
# It uses SADs inbuilt class notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley. We have built the class notion into 
# Naproche-SAD by replacing "set" by "class"

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

# [prove off]

Let x, y, z, r, s, t, a, b, c, d, e stand for classes.

Lemma. x=x.

Let a \neq b stand for a != b.
Let a \in b stand for a is an element of b.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y 
x = y iff for each z z \in x iff z \in y.

# II Classification axiom-scheme corresponds to the way
# "classifications", i.e., abstraction terms are handled
# in Naproche-SAD

Let the unordered pair of x and y stand for {x,y}.

# The following has been a problem before:
# We use <x,y> instead of {x y} because Naproche-SAD requires
# some symbolic or textual material between the variables
# x and y. We use {x;y} instead of {x,y} because the latter
# notion is an inbuilt set notation of Naproche-SAD.

x = r and y = s.

# We can interpret UU to mean undefined.
# Then ( , ) produces a a set or undefined.
# We can instead extend the signature (our language)
# by an elementary symbol ( , ), satisfying standard axioms ... .
# Ideally, we would like ( , ) to an "object" and
# not a set. Sets will also be objects.

Definition 56. A relation is a class r such that for each element z of r
there exist x and y such that z = (x,y).

Proof.
    We have ~ \-/ S = {1, -1}.
    Indeed n belongs to \-/ S iff n has a prime divisor.

    Assume that S is finite.
    Then \-/ S is closed and ~ \-/ S is open.

    Take p such that ArSeq(1,p) [= ~ \-/ S.
    ArSeq(1,p) has an element that does not belong to {1, -1}.
    proof.
        1 + p and 1 - p belong to ArSeq(1,p).
        1 + p !=  1 /\ 1 - p !=  1.
        1 + p != -1 \/ 1 - p != -1.
    end.
    Contradiction.

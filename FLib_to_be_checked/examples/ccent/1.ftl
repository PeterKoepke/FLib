Take a function P and a number r such that P lists A in r steps.
Take n=Prod(P,1,r)+1. n is nontrivial.
Take a prime divisor p of n.
Let us show that p is not an element of A.

Take i such that (1 <= i <= r and p=P(i)).
P(i) divides Prod(P,1,r) (by MultProd).
Indeed Seq(1,r) [= Dom P and Ran P [= Nat.
Then p divides 1 (by DivMin).

Hence A is not the set of prime numbers.

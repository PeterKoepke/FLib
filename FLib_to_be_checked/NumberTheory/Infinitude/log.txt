Log: Infinitude of Primes

Folder: Desktop/Infinitude

Original File: infinity_original.ftl 
Runs with:
./alice -vvvv -t 2 --depthlimit=8 -P eprover ~/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_original.ftl
(eprover time limit 2 sec)

File to strip away / modify LaTeX commands:
tex2ftl_original
Runs with something like: 
koepke@r100:~/P/Paskevich/sad-2.3-24$ sed -f ~/Desktop/Infinitude/tex2ftl_original examples/primes/test1.tex | ./alice -vvvv -P eprover

File starting with some useful LaTeX macros:
test1_original.tex


Go two directions: clean up the code / put LaTeX on top
Number the versions 00-99

01: cleaned up the code. Some proofs have to be expanded. Possibly being later in the document means that more (irrelevant) premises are given to eprover. I have to learn how to fit in proof steps.

Also put in some TaTeX macros for further work.

01 works like this:

[Reason] /home/koepke/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_01.ftl: verification successful
[Main] sections 241 - goals 49 - subgoals 127 - trivial 21 - proved 63

koepke@r100:~/P/Paskevich/sad-2.3-24$ ./alice -vvvv -t 5 --depthlimit=8 -P eprover ~/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_01.ftl

Works also with t 4 (seconds) but not with 3 seconds.

02: putting in some layout structure from the test1.tex and further cleaning of the ForTheL:

[Reason] /home/koepke/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_02.ftl: verification successful
[Main] sections 235 - goals 48 - subgoals 124 - trivial 22 - proved 61
[Main] symbols 583 - checks 442 - trivial 434 - proved 8 - unfolds 195

koepke@r100:~/P/Paskevich/sad-2.3-24$ ./alice -vvvv -t 4 --depthlimit=8 -P eprover ~/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_02.ftl 

03: first complete insertion of LaTeX.
[Reason] stdin: verification successful

infinity_04 with tex2ftl_00: most LaTeX inserted
[Reason] stdin: verification successful
[Main] sections 235 - goals 48 - subgoals 125 - trivial 21 - proved 62
[Main] symbols 583 - checks 442 - trivial 434 - proved 8 - unfolds 198
[Main] parser 00:00.49 - reason 00:03.51 - prover 02:49.47/00:03.31
[Main] total 02:53.48
koepke@r100:~/P/Paskevich/sad-2.3-24$ sed -f ~/Desktop/Infinitude/tex2ftl_00 ~/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_04.tex | ./alice -vvvv -t 5 -P eprover

Going to infinity_05 with tex2ftl_01
LaTeX is now satisfying, also the question about the unnamed theorem environment, that required an extra "." has been solved by a hack.
The files check like this:
[Reason] stdin: verification successful
[Main] sections 235 - goals 48 - subgoals 125 - trivial 21 - proved 62
[Main] symbols 583 - checks 442 - trivial 434 - proved 8 - unfolds 198
[Main] parser 00:00.63 - reason 00:06.47 - prover 04:13.20/00:05.47
[Main] total 04:20.32
koepke@r100:~/P/Paskevich/sad-2.3-24$ sed -f ~/Desktop/Infinitude/tex2ftl_01 ~/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_05.tex | ./alice -vvvv -t 5 -P eprover

There is however a problem with the BigProduct. It should be "defined" rather than "axiomatized", and the axioms at the moment are false, if
factors =0 occur.
This will be rectified in infinity_06 with tex2ftl_02.

06/02 is a test file, where we want to introduce the right BigProducts.

07/02 has a revised version of the BigProduct. It seems to be correct in
its postulates of BigProduct and it runs:

[Reason] stdin: verification successful
[Main] sections 236 - goals 50 - subgoals 132 - trivial 23 - proved 64
[Main] symbols 594 - checks 444 - trivial 436 - proved 8 - unfolds 236
[Main] parser 00:00.50 - reason 00:03.37 - prover 03:06.84/00:03.68
[Main] total 03:10.72
koepke@r100:~/P/Paskevich/sad-2.3-24$ sed -f ~/Desktop/Infinitude/tex2ftl_02 ~/Desktop/Infinitude/infinity_07.tex | ./alice -vvv -t 5 -P eprover

This is the version that I sent to colleagues.

08/03 Experiment with combining similar SAD environments into lists.

# 01-Formalizing Pairs and Functions

# Here we introduce ordered pairs the set-theoretic way as (a,b) = {{a},{a,b}} and show that this has the properties we want for an ordered pair.
# Relations are defined as a set of ordered paird and functions are introduced as relations with additional properties.
# We defined Id as the set of pairs (x,x) and showed that some basic properties about Id hold.

# In this section we do not distinguish between sets and zfsets. But we will see that even without the axiom of foundation
# we will come to a contradiction.

# Main Results:

# - For any set A there is an injective map F : A /rightarrow /PP A.
# - For any set A there is no injective map G : /PP A /rightarrow A.

# The second lemma leads to a contradiction: Since /VV is considered as a set itself we now have /VV = /PP /VV.
# So Id is in fact an injective map from /PP /VV to /VV.
# So here we see that even without foundation, only with the introduction of the power set we lead to a contradiction.
# So we need to introduce zfset even for basic set theory.

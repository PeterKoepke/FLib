# Set Theory in ForTheL

These are formalizations of basic axiomatic set theory. The content is inspired by the [script](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/ag/logik/teaching/2018WS/set_theory/current_scriptum.pdf) of the lecture *Set Theory* held by Prof. Peter Koepke at the University of Bonn in the winter term 18/19.

The formalizations finish with the proof of Silver's Theorem about the continuum function at singular cardinals of uncountable cofinality (page 52 in the script).

These ForThel files can be checked by Naproche-SAD, either with the [source code](https://github.com/Naproche/Naproche-SAD) or the [Isabelle/jEdit integration](https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Naproche-20190611/).

All folders have to be copied in the Example-folder of Naproche-SAD. In the application it is the folder
Isabelle_Naproche-20190611.app/Contents/Resources/Isabelle_Naproche-20190611/contrib/naproche-20190418/examples.

The total checking time of all files is about 4 hours (depending on the computer).

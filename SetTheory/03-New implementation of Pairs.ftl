# 3-New implementation of pairs

# This is the same as section 2, but now we use the integrated ordered pairs of Naproche.
# We need an axiom such that ordered pairs work as before.
# We also use the integrated functions. So now a function is not a set of ordered paird, but it has a domain and
# for any object in the domain we have an attached value.
# An axiom states that to functions are the same iff the domain is the same and all values are the same.
# Another axiom states that the domain of a function is a set.

# The main results are the same as in section 2 and we get the same contradiction in the end.

# Therefore we need to distinguish between zf-sets and proper classes.

# 1. Homomorphisms

Definition GrpHom000. Let G,H be groups. A group homomorphism between G and H is a map phi from G to
H such that phi(x \cdot y) = phi(x) \cdot phi(y) for all x,y \in G.


Lemma GrpHom002. Let G,H be groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H. Then phi is a
map.


# 1.1 Properties of homomorphisms between groups

Proposition GrpHom005. Let G,H be groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H. Let
x \in G. Then phi(x) \in H.


Proposition GrpHom010. Let G,H be groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H. Then
phi(1_{G}) = 1_{H}.

Proof.
  phi(1_{G}) = phi(1_{G}) = phi(1_{G} \cdot 1_{G}). phi(1_{G} \cdot 1_{G}) =
  phi(1_{G}) \cdot phi(1_{G}) (by GrpHom000). Indeed 1_{G} is an element of G. Hence the thesis (by
  GrpGrp162). Indeed phi(1_{G}) \in H.

Proposition GrpHom015. Let G,H be groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H. Let
x \in G. Then phi(x^{-1}) = phi(x)^{-1}.

Proof.
  phi(x^{-1}) \cdot phi(x) = phi(x^{-1} \cdot x) (by GrpHom000). Indeed x^{-1} \in G.
  phi(x^{-1} \cdot x) = phi(1_{G}) = 1_{H}. Hence the thesis (by GrpGrp155). Indeed phi(x^{-1}) and
  phi(x) are elements of H.
qed.


Proposition GrpHom020. Let G be a group. id_{G} is a group homomorphism between G and G.

Proof.
  id_{G} is a map from G to G. For all x,y \in G we have id_{G}(x \cdot y) =
  id_{G}(x) \cdot id_{G}(y). Indeed x \cdot y \in G for all x,y \in G.

Proposition GrpHom025. Let G,H,K be groups. Let phi be a group homomorphism between G and H and psi
be a group homomorphism between H and K. Then psi \circ phi is a group homomorphism between H and K.

Proof. [prove off] qed.


# 1.2 Properties of homomorphisms between abelian groups

Proposition GrpHom030. Let G,H be abelian groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H.
Let x,y \in G. Then phi(x + y) = phi(x) + phi(y).

Proof.
  phi(x + y) = phi(x \cdot y) = phi(x) \cdot phi(y) = phi(x) + phi(y) (by GrpAb005, GrpHom000,
  GrpHom005).
qed.


Proposition GrpHom035. Let G,H be abelian groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H.
Then phi(0_{G}) = 0_{H}.


Proposition GrpHom040. Let G,H be abelian groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H.
Let x \in G. Then phi(-x) = -phi(x).

Proof.
  phi(-x) = phi(x^{-1}). phi(x^{-1}) = phi(x)^{-1} (by GrpHom015). phi(x)^{-1} = -phi(x). Indeed
  phi(x) \in H.
qed.


Proposition GrpHom050. Let G,H be abelian groups and phi be a group homomorphism between G and H.
Let x,y \in G. Then phi(x - y) = phi(x) - phi(y).

Proof.
  phi(x - y) = phi(x + (-y)) = phi(x) + phi(-y) (by GrpAb015, GrpHom030). Indeed -y \in G.
  phi(-y) = -phi(y) (by GrpHom040). phi(x) + (-phi(y)) = phi(x) - phi(y) (by GrpAb015). Indeed
  phi(x),phi(y) \in H.

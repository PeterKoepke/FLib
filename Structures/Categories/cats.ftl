# 3.3 Some technical lemmas

Lemma CatCat155. Let C be a category. Then there is an element X of CAT_{1} such that
C = Cat_{1}(X).

Proof.
  Cat_{1} is a bijection between CAT_{1} and CAT. Cat_{1} is a surjective map. Thus we can take an
  element X of CAT_{1} such that Cat_{1}(X) = C (by FoundMap100, CatCat005). Indeed dom(Cat_{1}) =
  CAT_{1} and codom(Cat_{1}) = CAT.

Lemma CatCat157. Let C be a category and A \in Obj(C). Let O,H be classes and i,d,c,o be functions
such that (O,H,i,d,c,o) \in CAT_{1} and C = Cat_{1}(O,H,i,d,c,o). Then C^{-1}(A) \in O.

Proof.
  (C,(O,H,i,d,c,o)) satisfies CAT2 (by CatCat150). Hence Obj(C) = C[O]. Then A \in C[O].
  C[O] = {C(x) | x \in O \cap dom(C)} (by FoundMap180). Indeed C is a map. (C,(O,H,i,d,c,o))
  satisfies CAT1 (by CatCat150). Hence dom(C) = O \cup H. Thus O \cap dom(C) = O. Therefore C[O] =
  {C(x) | x \in O}. Then we can take an element a of O such that C(a) = A. a lies in the domain of
  C. Thus a = C^{-1}(A) (by FoundMap177). Indeed C is a bijective map.

Lemma CatCat158. Let C be a category and f \in Hom(C). Let O,H be classes and i,d,c,o be functions
such that (O,H,i,d,c,o) \in CAT_{1} and C = Cat_{1}(O,H,i,d,c,o). Then C^{-1}(f) \in H.

Proof.
  (C,(O,H,i,d,c,o)) satisfies CAT2 (by CatCat150). Hence Hom(C) = C[H]. Then f \in C[H].
  C[H] = {C(x) | x \in H \cap dom(C)} (by FoundMap180). Indeed C is a map. (C,(O,H,i,d,c,o))
  satisfies CAT1 (by CatCat150). Hence dom(C) = O \cup H. Thus H \cap dom(C) = H. Therefore C[H] =
  {C(x) | x \in H}. Then we can take an element g of H such that C(g) = f. g lies in the domain of
  C. Thus g = C^{-1}(f) (by FoundMap177). Indeed C is a bijective map.

# 4. Properties of categories

Proposition CatCat160. Let C be a category. Obj(C) is a class.

Proof.
  Take an element X of CAT_{1} such that C = Cat_{1}(X) (by CatCat155). Then we can take classes O,H
  and functions i,d,c,o such that X = (O,H,i,d,c,o) (by CatCat090). Obj(C) = C[O] (by CatCat110).
  Indeed (C,X) satisfies CAT2 (by CatCat150).
qed.


Proposition CatCat165. Let C be a category. Hom(C) is a class.

Proof.
  Take an element X of CAT_{1} such that C = Cat_{1}(X) (by CatCat155). Then we can take classes O,H
  and functions i,d,c,o such that X = (O,H,i,d,c,o) (by CatCat090). Hom(C) = C[H] (by CatCat110).
  Indeed (C,X) satisfies CAT2 (by CatCat150).
qed.


Proposition CatCat170. Let C be a category. range(C) = Obj(C) \cup Hom(C).

Proof.
  Take an element X of CAT_{1} such that C = Cat_{1}(X) (by CatCat155). Then we can take classes O,H
  and functions i,d,c,o such that X = (O,H,i,d,c,o) (by CatCat090). dom(C) = O \cup H (by
  CatCat100). Indeed (C,X) satisfies CAT1 (by CatCat150). range(C) = C[dom(C)] = C[O \cup H] (by
  FoundMap185). Indeed C is a map. C[O \cup H] = C[O] \cup C[H] (by FoundMap226). Indeed C is a map.
  C[O] = Obj(C) and C[H] = Hom(C) (by CatCat110). Indeed (C,X) satisfies CAT2 (by CatCat150).
qed.


Proposition CatCat175. Let C be a category. id_{A} \in Hom(C) for all A \in Obj(C).

Proof.
  Take an element X of CAT_{1} such that C = Cat_{1}(X) (by CatCat155). Then we can take classes O,H
  and functions i,d,c,o such that X = (O,H,i,d,c,o) (by CatCat090). Let A \in Obj(C). Then
  C^{-1}(A) \in O (by CatCat157). C is a bijective map and A \in range(C). Take a \in dom(C) such
  that a = C^{-1}(A) (by FoundMap178). Hence C(i(a)) = id_{C(a)} (by CatCat120). Indeed (C,X)
  satisfies CAT3. Thus id_{A} = C(i(a)). Indeed C is a bijective map. a \in O.
  Thus i(a) is an element of H (by CatCat045). Indeed X satisfies Cat2 (by CatCat090). dom(C) =
  O \cup H (by CatCat100). Indeed (C,X) satisfies CAT1. Therefore i(a) \in dom(C). Then
  i(a) \in H \cap dom(C). Hence C(i(a)) \in C[H]. Indeed C[H] = {C(x) | x \in H \cap dom(C)} (by
  FoundMap180). C[H] = Hom(C) (by CatCat110). Indeed (C,X) satisfies CAT2. Thus id_{A} \in Hom(C).

Proposition CatCat180. Let C be a category. dom(id_{X}) = X = codom(id_{X}) for all X \in Obj(C).

# This statement follows immediately from the fact that id_{X} is the identity map for arbitrary
# objects X. But we do not have to worry about it since the identity map and the identity morphism
# have the same behaviour with regard to composition.

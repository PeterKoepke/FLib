# 1. Morphisms

Definition CatMor000. A morphism is an entity f such that f is an element of Hom(C) for some
category C.

Definition CatMor005. Let X,Y be entities. A morphism between X and Y is a morphism f such that
dom(f) = X and codom(f) = Y.


Lemma CatMor010. Let f be a morphism. Then there is a category C and objects X,Y of C such that f is
a morphism between X and Y.

Proof.
  Take a category C such that f \in Hom(C). Take entities X,Y such that dom(f) = X and codom(f) = Y.
  Then X,Y are objects of C.

Definition CatMor015. Let X,Y be entities. Hom(X,Y) = {f | f is a morphism between X and Y}.


Definition CatMor020. An endomorphism is a morphism f such that dom(f) = codom(f).


Proposition CatMor025. Let C be a category and f \in Hom(C). Then dom(f) and codom(f) are objects of
C.


Lemma CatMor027. Let O,H be classes such that H is a homomorphism class over O. Let
X,Y \in Obj((O,H)_{CAT}). Let x,y \in O. Assume that X = (O,H)_{CAT}(x) and Y = (O,H)_{CAT}(y). Let
hom be a class such that hom = {f | f is a map from x to y}. Then Hom(X,Y) = (O,H)_{CAT}[hom].

# 3. Monic, epic, iso

# 3.1 Monomorphisms

Signature CarMor105. Let f be an entity. f is monic is an statement.

Axiom CatMor110. Let C be a category and Y,Z be objects of C. Let f: Y --> Z. f is monic iff for all
X \in Obj(C) and all g,h: X --> Y we have f \circ g = f \circ h  =>  g = h.


Definition CatMor115. A monomorphism is a monic morphism.

Definition CatMor120. Let X,Y be entities. A monomorphism between X and Y is a monic morphism
between X and Y.

Let f: X >--> Y stand for f is an monomorphism between X and Y.


Proposition CatMor125. Let f be a morphism that has a leftinverse. Then f is monic.

Proof.
  Take A category C and objects Y,Z of C such that f is a morphism between Y and Z (by CatMor010).
  Take a leftinverse g of f. g is a morphism between Z and Y such that g \circ f = id_{Y} (by
  CatMor070).

  For all X \in Obj(C) and all h,k: X --> Y we have f \circ h = f \circ k  =>  h = k.
  proof.
    Let X \in Obj(C) and h,k: X --> Y. Assume that f \circ h = f \circ k. Then g \circ (f \circ h) =
    g \circ (f \circ k). Hence (g \circ f) \circ h = (g \circ f) \circ k (by CatMor045). Indeed X is
    an object of C. Thus id_{Y} \circ h = id_{Y} \circ k. id_{Y} \circ h = h. id_{Y} \circ k = k.
    Therefore we have h = k.
  end.

  Hence the thesis (by CatMor110).

Proposition CatMor130. Let C be a category and X,Y,Z be objects of C. Let f: X --> Y and g: Y --> Z.
If f and g are monic then g \circ f is monic.

Proof.
  g \circ f is a morphism between X and Z (by CatMor030). Assume that f and g are monic.

  For all W \in Obj(C) and all h,k: W --> X we have (g \circ f) \circ h = (g \circ f) \circ k  =>
  h = k.
  proof.
    Let W \in Obj(C) and h,k: W --> X. Assume that (g \circ f) \circ h = (g \circ f) \circ k. W is
    an object of C. Then g \circ (f \circ h) = g \circ (f \circ k) (by CatMor045). Hence
    f \circ h = f \circ k (by CatMor110). Indeed f \circ h,f \circ k: W --> Y (by CatMor030). Thus
    h = k (by CatMor110).
  end.

  Hence the thesis (by CatMor110).

Proposition CatMor190. Any isomorphism is monic and epic.

Proof.
  Let f be an isomorphism. Take a morphism g that is an inverse of f. Then g is a rightinverse of f
  and a leftinverse of f (by CatMor080). Indeed f is a morphism. Hence the thesis.
qed.


Proposition CatMor195. Let X be an object. id_{X} is an isomorphism.

Proof.
  Take a category C such that X is an object of C. id_{X}: X --> X. id_{X} \circ id_{X} = id_{X}.
  Hence id_{X} is a leftinverse of id_{X} and a rightinverse of id_{X} (by CatMor070, CatMor075).

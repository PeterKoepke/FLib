# 1. Definitions

Definition SetCard000. Let x,y be sets. x \sim y iff there exists a bijection between x and y.

Let x and y are equipollent stand for x \sim y.
Let x and y are equipotent stand for x \sim y.
Let x and y have same cardinality stand for x \sim y.


Definition SetCard005. Let x,y be sets. x \preceq y iff there exists an injective function from x to
y.

Let x \succeq y stand for y \preceq x.

Let x has cardinality at most that of y stand for x \preceq y.
Let x has cardinality at least that of y stand for x \succeq y.

Let x \prec y stand for x \preceq y and not x \sim y.
Let x \succ y stand for x \succeq y and not x \sim y.

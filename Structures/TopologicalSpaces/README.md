# Topological spaces

This directory contains texts about topological spaces.


## Topological spaces

The file _topological-spaces.ftl_ introduces topological spaces as structures.
It provides two ways of constructing them and states basic properties about
open and closed sets. Moreover neighbourhoods are defined.


## Separation

The file _separation.ftl_ prodides the separations axioms T0, T1 and T2 and
states basic facts about them.


## Continuous maps

The file _continuous-maps.ftl_ defines continuous maps between topological
spaces. Discrete and indiscrete spaces are introduced and some basic properties
of continuous maps are proven. Moreover homeomorphisms are defined.


## Metrizable spaces

The file _metrizable-spaces.ftl_ defines a function which maps a metric space to
its "corresponding" topological spaces. Topological spaces which have a preimage
under this map are called metrizable. Some basic properties about metrizable
spaces are stated which are used to present a short proof of the fact that
singleton sets are closed in metric spaces.

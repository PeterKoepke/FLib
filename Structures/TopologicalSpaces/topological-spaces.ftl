# 1.3 Examples

Definition TopTop070. Let X be a set. The discrete topology on X is a class U such that U =
{A | A is a subset of X}.

Definition TopTop075. Let X be a set. The indiscrete topology on X is a class U such that U =
{\emptyset,X}.


Proposition TopTop080. Let X be a set. The discrete topology on X is a topology on X.

Proof.
  Take a class D that is the discrete topology on X. Then D = {A | A is a subset of X}. D is the
  powerset of X (by SetSet080). Hence D is a subset of the powerset of X.

  The empty set and X belong to D. Thus (X,D) satisfies TopOpen1 (by TopTop005).

  For all A,B \in D we have A \cap B \in D.
  proof.
    Let A,B \in D. Then A,B are subsets of X. Hence A \cap B is a set. Every element of A \cap B
    lies in X. Hence A \cap B is a subset of X.
  end.

  Thus D is closed under finite intersections (by SetSs010). Therefore (X,D) satisfies TopOpen2 (by
  TopTop015).

  For all nonempty subsets U of D we have \bigcup U \in D.
  proof.
    Let U be a nonempty subset of D. Every element of U is a subset of X. Hence \bigcup U is a set.
    Every element of \bigcup U lies in X. Hence \bigcup U is a subset of X.
  end.

  Hence D is closed under arbitrary unions (by SetSs040). Thus (X,D) satisfies TopOpen3 (by
  TopTop025).

Proposition TopTop085. Let X be a set. The discrete topology on X is a topology of closed sets on X.

Proof.
  Take a class D that is the discrete topology on X. Then D = {A | A is a subset of X}. D is the
  powerset of X (by SetSet080). Hence D is a subset of the powerset of X.

  The empty set and X belong to D. Thus (X,D) satisfies TopClosed1 (by TopTop040).

  For all A,B \in D we have A \cup B \in D.
  proof.
    Let A,B \in D. Then A,B are subsets of X. Hence A \cup B is a set. Every element of A \cup B
    lies in X. Thus A \cup B is a subset of X.
  end.

  Hence D is closed under finite unions (by SetSs020). Thus (X,D) satisfies TopClosed2 (by
  TopTop050).

  For all nonempty subsets U of D we have \bigcap U \in D.
  proof.
    Let U be a nonempty subset of D. Then every element of U is a subset of X. Hence \bigcap U is a
    set. Every element of \bigcap U lies in X. Thus \bigcap U is a subset of X (by SetSet082).
  end.

  Hence D is closed under arbitrary intersections (by SetSs035). Thus (X,D) satisfies TopClosed3 (by
  TopTop060).

Proposition TopTop090. Let X be a set. The indiscrete topology on X is a topology on X.

Proof.
  Take a class I that is the indiscrete topology on X. I = {\emptyset,X}. Every element of I is a
  subset of X. Hence I is a subset of the powerset of X. I is a system of sets.

  The empty set and X belong to I. Hence (X,I) satisfies TopOpen1 (by TopTop005).

  For all A,B \in I we have A \cap B \in I.
  proof.
    Let A,B \in I.

    Case A,B = \emptyset. Obvious.

    Case A,B = X. Obvious.

    Case A = \emptyset and B = X. Obvious.

    Case A = X and B = \emptyset. Obvious.
  end.

  Hence I is closed under finite intersections (by SetSs010). Thus (X,I) satisfies TopOpen2 (by
  TopTop015).

  For all nonempty subsets U of I we have \bigcup U \in I.
  proof.
    Let U be a nonempty subset of I.

    Case U = {\emptyset}.
      \bigcup U = \emptyset.
    end.

    Case U = {X}.
      \bigcup U = X.
    end.

    Case U = {\emptyset,X}.
      U = `{\emptyset,X}`. Therefore \bigcup U = \emptyset \cup X (by FoundCl090). Indeed \emptyset
      and X are classes.
    end.
  end.

  Hence I is closed under arbitrary unions (by SetSs040). Thus (X,I) satisfies TopOpen3 (by
  TopTop025).

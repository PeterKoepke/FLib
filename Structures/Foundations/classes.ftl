    Let u \in x \cap (y \cup z). Then u \in x and u \in y \cup z. Hence u \in x and (u \in y or

  proof.
    Let u \in x \cup (y \cap z). Then u \in x or u \in y \cap z. Hence u \in x or (u \in y and
    u \in z). Thus (u \in x or u \in y) and (u \in x or u \in z). Therefore u \in x \cup y and
    u \in x \cup z.

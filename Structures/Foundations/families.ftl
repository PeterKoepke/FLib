# 4. Products

# 4.1 Products over families of classes

Axiom FoundFam350. Let A be a family of classes. Prod(A) is a class such that

  Prod(A) = {a | a is a family over dom(A) and a(i) \in A(i) for all i \in dom(a)}.


Proposition FoundFam355. Let A be a family of classes. Assume that some value of A is empty. Then
Prod(A) is empty.

Proof.
  Assume the contrary. Take an element x of Prod(A). Take i \in dom(A) such that A(i) = \emptyset.
  Then x(i) \in A(i). Indeed Prod(A) = {a | a is a family over dom(A) and a(j) \in A(j) for all

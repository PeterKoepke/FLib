# 1. Axioms for structures

Signature FoundStr000. A structure is an injective function that is a class.

Axiom FoundStr002. Let X be a structure. The domain of X is a class.

Axiom FoundStr005. Let X be a structure. range(X) = X.

Axiom FoundStr007. Every element of any structure is an element.


Proposition FoundStr009. Let X be a structure and A be a subset of the domain of X. Then X[A] is a
subset of X.

Proof.
  Every value of X is an element. Indeed every value of X lies in X. Hence X[A] is a set (by
  SetSet060). Indeed X is a function. X[A] = {X(a) | a \in A} (by FoundMap188). Indeed X is a map
  and A is a subclass of dom(X). Hence every element of X[A] lies in X.

Proposition FoundStr010. Let X be a structure. X is a bijection between the domain of X and X.


Proposition FoundStr015. Let X be a structure. X^{-1} is a bijection between X and the domain of X.

Proof.
  X is a bijection between dom(X) and X. Hence X is a bijective map. Thus X is invertible (by
  FoundMap170). Indeed X is bijective. Hence X^{-1} is bijective (by FoundMap175).
qed.


Proposition FoundStr020. Let X be a structure and x be an element of the domain of X. Then X(x) is
an element of X.

Proof.
  X(x) lies in the range of X.
qed.


Proposition FoundStr025. Let X be a structure and y be an element of X. Then there is an element x
of the domain of X such that X(x) = y.

Proof.
  X is a surjective map. y is an element of the codomain of X. Hence we have the thesis (by
  FoundMap100).
qed.


Proposition FoundStr030. Let X be a structure and x,y be elements of the domain of X. x = y iff
X(x) = X(y).

Proof.
  X is an injective map. Hence the thesis (by FoundMap092).
qed.


Proposition FoundStr031. Let X be a structure and A be a class. X[A] = {X(a) | a \in A \cap dom(X)}.

Proof.
  X is a map. Hence we have the thesis (by FoundMap180).

# 2. Small and large structures

Definition FoundStr035. A small structure is a structure that is a set.

Definition FoundStr036. A large structure is a structure that is a proper class.


# 3. Maps between structures

Axiom FoundStr047. Let X be a structure and f be a map such that dom(f) = X. Let x be an element of
the domain of X. Then f(x) = f(X(x)). # Do we really need that?!

Axiom FoundStr048. Let X be a structure and f be a map such that dom(f) = X. Let A be a
subclass of the domain of X. Then f[A] = f[X[A]].

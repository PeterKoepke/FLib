# Classes

Let a class stand for a collection.


# Inequality

Let x \neq y stand for x is not equal to y.


# Elementhood

Let x \in y         stand for x is an element of y.
Let y \ni x         stand for x is an element of y.
Let x lies in y     stand for x is an element of y.
Let x belongs to y  stand for x is an element of y.
Let y contains x    stand for x is an element of y.

Let x \notin y      stand for x is not an element of y.


# Domain

Let dom(f)          stand for Dom(f).
Let the domain of f stand for Dom(f).


# Function application

Let the value of f at x stand for f(x).

Let f(x,y) stand for f((x,y)).


# Axioms

Signature TechPre000. An axiom is a notion.

Signature TechPre005. Let A be an axiom and x be an entity. x satisfies A is a statement.


# Misc

Axiom TechPre010. Let x,y be entities. Assume that y = {u | u \in x}. Then y is a class.

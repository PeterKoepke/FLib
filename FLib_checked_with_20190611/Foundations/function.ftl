[synonym element/-s] [synonym map/-s] 

Signature. An element is a notion.

Let x,y,z stand for elements.

Signature.  A map is a notion.

Let f,g,h stand for maps.

Signature. f(x) is an element.

Signature. f*g is a map.

Axiom. (f*g)(x)=f(g(x)).

Definition. f is surjective iff for all y there exists x such that f(x)=y.

Definition. f is injective iff for all x,y if f(x)=f(y) then x=y.

Theorem. Let f and g be surjective. Then f*g is surjective.

Theorem. Let f and g be injective. Then f*g is injective.

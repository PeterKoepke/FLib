# Representation Theory in ForTheL
These are formalizations of some topics from representation theory of algebras to be checked by Naproche-SAD.

The linear algebra formalizations are a rewrite of those at
https://github.com/naproche-community/FLib/tree/master/linear_algebra_ftl.

To run the formalizations in Naproche-SAD, create a folder "representations" inside the "examples" folder and paste the FTL files there.

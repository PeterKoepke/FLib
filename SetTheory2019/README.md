# Set Theory

This is an approach on formalizing the
[script](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/ag/logik/teaching/2018WS/set_theory/current_scriptum.pdf) of an
introducory lecture on set theory. The formalizations wewe created during a practical course on
mathematical logic at the University of Bonn in 2019.

It deals with the order type and order isomorphisms, cardinality, a proof of the Cantor-Bernstein
theorem, cardinal numbers, finite and countabe sets, a proof of Cantor's theorem, basic cardinal
arithmetic, cofinality and regularity, and finally a proof of KÃ¶nig's theorem.
